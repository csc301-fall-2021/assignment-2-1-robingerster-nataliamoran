# Pair Programming 
### Procedure
To kickstart our workflow we decided to start the assignment using pair programming over Zoom. In our first session on Monday (01/11/21) we first scanned the project requirements and discussed ideas. We continued to setup
our API project using Django and SQLite. Also, we implemented the models required to store the information read from the csv files and started work on the create function found in views.py to pass this data. During this
first session Natalia served as the driver actively writing code and Robin as the navigator responsible for reviewing code. 

On Tuesday (02/11/21) we inverted our approach and had Robin become the driver and Natalia the navigator. During this session the team continued work on the create method and began work on verifying csv files to check if
they followed one of the four formats from the GitHub on the assignment handout. To end the session we held a brief discussion on how to efficiently divide tasks between ourselves. 

Starting from Wednesday (03/11/21) team members started to work on their designated tasks individually. When stuck or a major milestone was achieved that required the other's attention we hosted more pair programming sessions. 
For instance, once one of us finished the basic unit testing functionality we had a quick meeting in which that person would be the navigator and explain to the driver how to implement tests for their code. Of course, the driver in
this scenario would write one or two tests while being guided by the supervisor.
